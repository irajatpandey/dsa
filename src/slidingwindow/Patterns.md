<h1> Patterns for Sliding Window Problems</h1>

```java
class Template {
    
    public static int genericSlidingWindowTemplate(){
        int i = 0, j = 0, ans = 0;
        for(;j<N; ++j) {
            // CODE: use A[j] to update state which might make the window invalid
            for (; invalid(); ++i) { // when invalid, keep shrinking the left edge until it's valid again
                // CODE: update state using A[i]
            }
            ans = max(ans, j - i + 1); // the window [i, j] is the maximum window we've found thus far
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```

Let's break down the intuition behind the condition (j - i + 1) * A[j] - sum > k in a simpler way.

Imagine you have a moving window that slides over the array. This window defines a subarray at each position. The left boundary of the window is represented by index i, and the right boundary is represented by index j.

Now, let's focus on the value of (j - i + 1) * A[j]. This value represents the sum of the current subarray if all elements in that subarray were equal to the value of A[j]. In other words, if all elements within the window were replaced with A[j], this is the sum we would get.

The variable sum represents the actual sum of the elements within the window.

Now, let's consider the difference between these two sums: (j - i + 1) * A[j] - sum. This difference tells us how much we would need to increase each element within the window to make them all equal to A[j]. If this difference is greater than k, it means that we would need to increase some elements by more than k units, which violates our constraint. So, the condition checks if this difference exceeds our limit k.

If the difference exceeds k, it indicates that we need to make adjustments to the subarray to maintain the non-decreasing property while staying within the limit k.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the intuition behind the condition! Let me know if you need further clarification.
